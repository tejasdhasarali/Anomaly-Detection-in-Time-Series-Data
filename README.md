# Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data

* Anomaly was introduced to the data by the WiFi pings of people passing by the shop

* The pattern in the data over time was found using the unsupervised variational autoencoders built using Fully Connected Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM)

* Auto Encoders using Fully Connected Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM) was also built to compare the performance of the variational autoencoder

* The Complete report of the project can be seen in the file Python Report PDF file
