# Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data

* The project aims to find the anomalies in the time series data of the number of people visiting a shop collected through the WiFi pings.

* Anomaly was introduced to the data by the WiFi pings of people passing by the shop.

* The pattern in the data over time was found using the unsupervised variational autoencoders built using Fully Connected Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM).

* Auto Encoders using Fully Connected Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM) was also built to compare the performance of the variational autoencoder.

* The Complete report of the project can be seen in the file Python Report PDF file.
